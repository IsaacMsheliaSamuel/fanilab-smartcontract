**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Drivers may prefer different currencies than senders.

### Decision
Add optional settlement contract for currency swaps.

### Rationale
- Cross-border flexibility
- Driver preference support
- DeFi integration
- Increased adoption

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Multi-currency support
- Better driver experience
- More use cases

**Negative**:
- Additional complexity
- Slippage risk
- Requires liquidity

## ADR-010: Delivery-Escrow State Machine Coupling

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Delivery completion and fund release involve two separate contracts (delivery_contract and escrow_contract) with independent state machines. Without enforced synchronization invariants, these states can silently desynchronize when cross-contract calls fail or are executed in unexpected orders, leading to locked or incorrectly released funds with no audit trail.

### Decision
Implement explicit state-machine invariants that ensure delivery and escrow states remain synchronized:
- **Pending/Active** delivery → Locked escrow
- **InTransit** delivery → Locked escrow  
- **Delivered** delivery → Released escrow
- **Disputed** delivery → Paused escrow
- **Cancelled** delivery → Refunded escrow

Provide a read-only `get_combined_state(delivery_id)` view that fetches both records and validates synchronization, enabling off-chain indexers and auditors to detect desynchronization.

### Rationale
- **Prevents silent failures**: Cross-contract call failures now panic rather than silently leaving escrow unmodified
- **Auditability**: Combined state view enables off-chain detection of mismatched states
- **Explicit invariants**: Clear documentation of expected state relationships
- **Easier debugging**: Audit trail is explicit rather than requiring manual cross-referencing

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Impossible to reach an invalid state combination
- Off-chain indexers can detect desynchronization instantly
- Clear failure modes for contract coordination issues
- Better protocol reliability

**Negative**:
- Slightly increased gas cost for combined state reads
- Must carefully order cross-contract calls to avoid reversions
- Requires coordination during emergency state corrections

### Alternatives Considered
- Single unified contract: Would increase contract size and reduce modularity
- Event-based state sync: Relies on off-chain consistency which is not guaranteed
- Optional validation: Allows silent desynchronization if not called

## ADR-011: Shared Governance Abstraction

**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Status**: Revised (see Addendum below) — the `AdminManager` module described
in the original decision was built but never adopted by any contract, and
was removed as dead code during the FC-1 cleanup batch (see
`docs/CODEBASE_FINAL_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`). The original Context/Decision/
Rationale sections are kept for history; see the Addendum for what was
actually implemented instead.

### Context
Admin/governance models are implemented inconsistently across the six contracts: escrow_contract, delivery_contract, fleet_management_contract, and identity_reputation_contract each use a single Admin: Address pattern (with rotation support only in escrow_contract), while dispute_resolution_contract uses a multi-admin model with per-address boolean storage. This leads to different security properties and inconsistent APIs across the protocol.

### Decision
Introduce a shared `governance` module in `shared_types` that provides `AdminManager` utility functions for both single-admin and multi-admin patterns, enabling contracts to adopt consistent governance practices.

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: All contracts can share the same governance primitives with well-understood security properties
- **Auditability**: Centralized governance logic is easier to audit and review
- **Maintainability**: Bug fixes to governance logic benefit all contracts
- **Flexibility**: Module supports both single-admin and multi-admin patterns
- **Incremental migration**: Contracts can adopt the shared abstraction independently

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Single source of truth for governance logic
- Consistent admin APIs across protocol
- Easier to implement complex governance (e.g., rotation, thresholds)
- Better auditability
- Shared tests and documentation

**Negative**:
- Requires updating existing contracts (can be done incrementally)
- May require version bump if breaking changes introduced
- Adds dependency on shared_types governance module

### Alternatives Considered
- Monolithic single-contract approach: Reduces modularity and gas optimization
- No shared abstraction: Inconsistency continues, harder to audit
- Immutable governance patterns: Loses flexibility for future requirements

### Future Work
- Migrate all six contracts to use the shared AdminManager
- Add threshold-based multi-sig support if needed
- Document governance security model in GOVERNANCE.md

### Addendum (FC-1 re-evaluation)
`shared_types::governance::AdminManager` was implemented per this ADR but
never wired into any contract — confirmed via a repo-wide grep finding zero
references outside its own definition. Re-evaluating it against the actual
governance needs across the six contracts found two separate problems it
didn't solve well:

1. **The single-admin case already had a better answer.** A simpler
   `shared_types::is_admin(env, caller) -> bool` function (no `AdminDataKey`
   indirection) already existed and was already adopted by `escrow_contract`
   and `delivery_contract`. `AdminManager::is_single_admin` would have been
   a strictly more complex way to do the same thing. Instead of wiring in
   `AdminManager`, `fleet_management_contract` and
   `identity_reputation_contract` were migrated onto `is_admin` directly,
   deleting their local, duplicate single-admin helpers
   (`is_fleet_admin` and an inline `DataKey::Admin` comparison,
   respectively). Four of six contracts now share one single-admin
   implementation.
2. **The multi-admin case was a downgrade, not an improvement.**
   `dispute_resolution_contract`'s existing multi-admin implementation
   (`DataKey::Admin(Address) -> bool` flags for O(1) membership checks,
   plus a separately maintained `DataKey::AdminList` for enumeration, with
   a last-admin-removal guard added in a prior hardening batch) is more
   efficient than `AdminManager::is_multi_admin`, which stores admins as a
   single `Vec<Address>` and does an O(n) linear scan per check. Migrating
   dispute_resolution_contract onto `AdminManager` would have meant
   rewriting a working, tested, already-hardened implementation to be
   *slower*, for no consistency benefit beyond sharing a struct name.

Multi-admin support is a genuinely different governance model from
single-admin, not a duplicate implementation of the same thing — merging
them into one abstraction would have meant either losing multi-admin
support entirely or forcing every single-admin contract through
multi-admin's less efficient storage shape. `dispute_resolution_contract`
keeping its own implementation is treated as an intentional architectural
boundary, not unaddressed duplication (see Issue #77's disposition in
`docs/CODEBASE_FINAL_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`).

`AdminManager` and its `AdminDataKey` enum were deleted from
`shared_types` accordingly.
